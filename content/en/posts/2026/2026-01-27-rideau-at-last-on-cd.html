    Rideau ! at last on CD
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Rideau!  is available on CD on  Klang Galerie , an Austrian labl. It was Un Drame Musical Instantané's second album, originally released in 1980 on the group's own GRRR label. Since its creation in 1976, featuring Jean-Jacques Birgé, Bernard Vitet and Francis Gorgé, the group has decided to promote collective musical creation, co-signing their albums, which they consider as artworks in themselves, or their live shows which they try to renew every time they play. Un Drame borrowed their sources from rock (synthetizer player Birgé and guitarist Gorgé, both authors of the album, Défense de); jazz (trumpeter Vitet who founded the first free jazz band in France, together with François Tusques, as well as Michel Portal who played with many American and European jazzmen); classical modern music; as well as movies or world news; they were the first in France to give a new impetus to live music on silent films. Birgé and Gorgé also recorded a duo album that was mentioned on the infamous Nurse With Wound list,  Défense de . On  Rideau! , you will hear their wild mix of styles, a very original, unclassifiable, inventive music, which drifts from jazz to electronic music and contemporary music. Remastered in 2016 and with a lot of bonus tracks (75 minutes instead of 40), amongst them the track that appeared on United Dairies' compilation album  In Fractured Silence  for the first time in its full length! Track list: 1.  M'enfin  2.  Rideau!  3.  La critique  4.  Pas besoin d'espérer pour entreprendre ni de réussir pour persévérer  5.  Tunnel sous la Manche  6.  La peur du vide  7.  Légitime défense  8.  Le directeur paiera pour ses crimes ALL ON FRENCH BLOG...</p>
