    <p>  <br>The 100th Anniversary in The Wire Article in  THE WIRE  (Nov. 2018, #417, p.69, Modern Composition by Julian Cowley) : Parisian Jean-Jacques Birgé has been making records, directing films and running the label Grrr since the mid-1970s. Now, with this exuberant hour-long project, he peers ahead to 2052 and celebrates the centenary of his own birth. A coda, marking his eventual death, has been composed by Sacha Gattino who salutes the playful ness of his friend's creative life, audible in their shared love of toy instruments and everyday sounding objects. A chiming music box, recorded during Birgé's childhood, provides a point of departure for his delirious romp through time. Skilfully crafted montage captures the flavour of each decade. Chanson xith lilting accordion, searing electric guitar or synths and orchestral pomp provide temporal markers, but within each frame a host of sounds are layered and scrambled. Birgé's kaleidoscopic imagination has produced a widly entertaining electroacoustic chronicle, oozing joie de vivre, naturally.</p>
