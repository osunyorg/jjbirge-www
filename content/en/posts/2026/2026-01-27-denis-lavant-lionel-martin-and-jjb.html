    Denis Lavant, Lionel Martin and JJB

    <p>  <br>Lionel Martin  and Jean-Jacques Birgé had been dreaming of this meeting for a long time. All had juggled their schedules, and on November 21, the snowstorm turned into a soundstorm thanks to a recording at Studio GRRR with  Denis Lavant . The actor had brought along six incredible texts by little-known French writers, raw, poetic and moving works. The trio played as a live concert, improvising freely as the sound invaded the studio. It was truly rock 'n roll, gripping, electric! Lionel was on tenor sax with effects, Jean-Jacques on keyboard and loads of weird instruments, Denis even punctuated his powerful evocations with a little flute tune, a musical snail or a Tibetan horn. In all, 118 minutes of rare intensity. A record is obviously very tempting ;-)</p>
