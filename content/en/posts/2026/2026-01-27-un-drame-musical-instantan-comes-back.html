    Un Drame Musical Instantané comes back

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>February 14, 2022 is a great day as it marks the return of UN DRAME MUSICAL INSTANTANÉ, officially disbanded in 2008.  Spending just a few hours they recorded 15 short pieces that they mixed the following day. The order is preserved, first takes, no cuts, just a rebalancing of the tracks.  Dominique Meens' texts are the guiding thread for Birgé and Gorgé. They find in them the images they have always sought wherever they go, setting the scene which in turn gives the poet wings. His text  Plumes et poils  refers to the one by Michel Tournier that the Drame had chosen to play with the late singer Frank Royon Le Mée. The bestiary has always been a major inspiration for the writer as well as for the two musicians. But where will they nestle!  The Gustave Doré’s engraving on the cover suggests a tragedy, but it is only a fable by Jean de La Fontaine. When you open the digipack, the movement of the photograph reveals another snapshot. Feather or hair? Feathers and hairs (translation of  plumes et poils ) !</p>
