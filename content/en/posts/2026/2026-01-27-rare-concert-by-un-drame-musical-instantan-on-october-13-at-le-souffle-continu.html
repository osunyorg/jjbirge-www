    <p>  <br>Friday October 13 at 6:30pm, I'll be playing a short set with  Francis Gorgé  (guitar) and  Amandine Casadamont  (turntables) at Souffle Continu, 22 rue Gerbier in Paris. I'm announcing this in advance because I don't get out much, and it's free! We'll be presenting the LP reissue of IN FRACTURED SILENCE, released in 1984 on Steven Stapleton's United Dairies label, and released that day on the Souffle Continu label (there's also a CD version, which is a first!). It's a collective album with three other pieces by  Hélène Sage , Sema (Robert Haigh) and Nurse With Wound (yes, the one from the famous list). I'll be playing the wooden thing you see in the foreground, which I've been working on all summer. I look forward to seeing you there...</p>
