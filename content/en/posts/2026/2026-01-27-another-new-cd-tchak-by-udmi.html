    Another new CD : TCHAK by UDMI

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>TCHAK , recorded between 1998 and 2000 by  Jean-Jacques Birgé , brings together the last recordings of  Un Drame Musical Instantané  with trumpeter  Bernard Vitet , its co-founder in 1976 with Francis Gorgé and him. The guitarist left the group in 1992, but rejoined in 2014. Together with Birgé and writer Dominique Meens, Gorgé is preparing a new album in the fictional spirit of the original group. For  TCHAK  resembles nothing the Drame had ever produced, which is hardly surprising given the sheer variety and surprise of their works, from their instantaneous compositions to works written for their large band or symphony orchestras, from their film-concerts, for which they were at the origin of this revival, to their particularly eccentric musical theater pieces...</p>  <p>   <br>TCHAK is a kind of electro funk that begins with  Le silence éternel des espaces infinis m'effraie , a duet between Birgé on machines and Vitet on flugelhorn, whose magnificent sound is legendary. This is followed by six tracks on which they are joined by guitarist  Philippe Deschepper  and turntablist  Nem :  Stomp, (roots), Gaza, 1936, Vir-us . Vitet also dabbles in reggy, while Birgé plays synthesizer and sampler, reed trumpet and nose flute, erhu and Theremin. On Bandcamp This Drame, here fundamentally instrumental, closes with  Machiavel Meeting , recorded live at Glaz'Art during a memorable evening that turned into a riot when so many people could not come in on November 18, 1998, for the launch party of the Machiavel CD. The quartet is joined by  Yves Robert  on trombone,  Hervé Legeay  on electric guitar,  Didier Petit  on cello,  Olivier Koechlin  on double bass and  Étienne Auger  on groovebox.</p>  <p>   <br>Étienne Mineur  designed the superb cover.</p>
