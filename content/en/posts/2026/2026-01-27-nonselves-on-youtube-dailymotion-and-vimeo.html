    NONSELVES on YouTube, DailyMotion and Vimeo

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>NONSELVES on YouTube, DailyMotion and Vimeo</p>  <p>   <br>With NONSELVES composer and performer  Jean-Jacques Birgé  provides an improvised (in real time) soundtrack for images derived from the interactive work NONSELF, created by  John Sanborn . This collaboration is a wild ride of sonic and social satire, mixing serious and silly with equal force. You can play the original work, which was commissioned by Jeu de Paume, at  nonself.me To give an idea of the live shows, Birgé has recorded a live version for Internet on October 7th 2019, but, as it's improvised, each show is different.  </p>  <p>   <br>On   YouTube ,  Dailymotion   and   Vimeo</p>
