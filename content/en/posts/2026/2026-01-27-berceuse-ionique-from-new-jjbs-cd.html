    <p>  <br>Berceuse ionique (from new JJB's CD) The first video of Jean-Jacques Birgé's album,  Perspectives for the 22nd Century , is online.  Sonia Cruchon  chose the Ionic Lullaby by playing with the silhouettes of survivors of the disaster. Images of the past inhabit these colored shadows. JJB asked each director to draw inspiration from the archives discovered on the ruins of the Museum d'Ethnologie de Genève, which commissioned the work and produced the CD, to invent their future. We are in 2152. He had thus proceeded with music, based on 31 pieces recorded between 1930 and 1952 from the  Constantin Brăiloiu  Fund kept at the International Archives of Popular Music (AIMP) of the  MEG . Brăiloiu (1893-1958) is a major reference in the field of traditional music. This hörspiel where voices come from far away combines acoustic instruments, some of which belong to the MEG collections, virtual instruments, atmospheres and sound archives. Troubling echo of current events in these times of questions about the future of the planet and of humanity,  Perspectives for the 22nd Century  was inspired by the reading of a novel by  C.F. Ramuz  to whom he dedicated the work as well as another writer,  Vercors . The next videos will be by  Eric Vernhes ,  Nicolas Clauss ,  John Sanborn ,  Valéry Faidherbe , Sonia Cruchon and  Nicolas Le Du.</p>
