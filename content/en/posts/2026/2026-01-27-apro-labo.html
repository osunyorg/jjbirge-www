    <p>  <br>New formula! Recordings now take place in public at Studio GRRR. The freedom of independence for the pleasure of the senses... Excellent acoustic conditions, delicious food... The idea is always to privilege the quality of the encounters, counting on the fact that the music will inevitably feel the effects. For this premiere, Jean-Jacques Birgé will be accompanied by two exceptional musicians in every respect: violinist  Mathias Lévy  and saxophonist/clarinettist  Antonin-Tri Hoang . Birgé has chosen to extend the adventure of my Pique-nique au labo (vol.  1/2 ,  3 ) by organizing live concerts/recordings at Studio GRRR. On the one hand, it's a way of escaping the scallop race organized by those in charge of programming both small and large venues. On the other hand, in the face of political decisions that are more manipulative than democratic, and in the face of the formatting imposed by the cultural industry, local work is crucial. Concerts are followed by an aperitif shared between artists and spectators. Antonin has devised an original and highly amusing protocol with the audience to encourage our instant compositions. What's more, benefiting from excellent acoustic conditions, they are recorded live and put online free of charge a few days later in the form of a virtual album. Gauge is obviously limited. There will be many concerts during this new year, and you can let us know if you're interested in taking part in one of the next Apéros-Labos by  writing to us ...</p>
