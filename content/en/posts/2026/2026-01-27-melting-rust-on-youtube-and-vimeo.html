    <p>  <br>MELTING RUST on YouTube and Vimeo</p>  <p>   <br>MELTING RUST , the audiovisual performance by  Anne-Sarah Le Meur  and Jean-Jacques Birgé is  on YouTube  and  on Vimeo . It is the captation of the creation at Victoria in Transylvania (Romania) done by Irina Botea and Jon Dean. Every show is different as both of them improvise. This version does not reproduce the emotion of the live show, it's in mono and shot  in the darkness of the theater. It's better to watch/hear it on full screen or during the future shows! MELTING RUST  is the first part of the next show with  NONSELVES  where Birgé improvises also on videos by John Sanborn (original adaptation of  NONSELF  commissioned by Jeu de Paume)...</p>
