    DDD publishes 4 remix of L'homme à la caméra

    <p>  <br>1895, 1929, 1973, 1984, 1999, 2014, 2017, so many landmarks to give birth to this beautiful object! The French label  DDD  publishes 4 remix of the album  L'homme à la caméra  by Un Drame Musical Instantané on a  transparent LP sold together with the original LP (pressed in 1984). New Yorker  Jorge VELEZ  aka Professor Genius, Australian Dro Carey aka  Tuff SHERM , Polish  Eltron JOHN  and famous  Thurston MOORE  participated in this crazy project. Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) had been recording  7/11  en 1999, but it remained unissued until now. More recently Xavier Ehretsmann ordered the three other remix.  In October 2014, English magazine WIRE had published Eltron John's piece on CD  Below The Radar Special Edition: The Dream , compilation of experimental and electronic music put together by the Kraków Unsound Festival. The transparency of the REMIX LP shows the original cover by UN D.M.I. where one can see a picture of the  film by Dziga VERTOV  and the 15 members of Un D.M.I.'s ochestra at Théâtre Déjazet on January 14th 1984. There's only a round sticker with the name of the four remixers. Coline Malivel artwork is inspired by a dia from the light-show L'Œuf Hyaloïde cofounded by Jean-Jacques BIRGÉ, extract from the  Light-Book  printed by Imprimerie Union in 1973.</p>
