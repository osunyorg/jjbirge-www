    The 1st ever recording by Un D.M.I.

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Très toxique  is the first ever recording of  Un Drame Musical Instantané  as a trio, three weeks before  Trop d’adrénaline nuit , but already a year and a half after  Défense de  by Birgé Gorgé Shiroc (Nurse With Wound List). On December 21, 1976, it was the first time the three musicians met together in the basement of Studio GRRR. They had no idea what they were going to play, but the session was full of energy. Jean-Jacques Birgé plays the ARP 2600 synthesizer, the cassettes and many other instruments, as does Bernard Vitet, mainly on percussion, but also on sax and violin, while Francis Gorgé supports the backbone on electric guitar. Half a century has passed. Birgé creates the cover of  Très toxique  entirely by hand, using a white pencil and two acid-burnt images he had created in 1969 and printed two years later by the art printer of Picasso, Dubuffet and the Collège de Pataphysique. The 85 numbered and signed copies of this limited edition have only one side of 19 minutes, already a collector! But can anyone tell me what this music sounds like? Sold by  Dizonord  (Paris) - dist.  The Pusher  Distribution</p>
