    <p>  <br>NEW AUDIO VERSION online February 14 2012 World premiere on January 26 2012 at Musée d'Art Moderne et Contemporain de Strasbourg for exhibition  "Europe and the spirit world or fascination with the occult, 1750-1950" </p>  <p>Rehearsals recorded at Studio GRRR,  November 19 2011 (4) and January 24 2012 (1-2-3) Video extracts  of the creation </p>  <p>Divided into four stations ( Antechamber, The Long White Corridor, Experience of Heaven and Hell, The Room and its Ghosts ) the show consists of a seance where three masters of ceremony use their musical instruments to summon the spirits of artists who have been interested in the occult. The role of the orchestra is to lead the audience through the long white corridor that leads to Swedenborg's room, so that everyone can choose their own heaven or hell. The spectators will meet the spectres of many of the exhibited artists... The bells will ring as much as they can, the celestial voices will rise in the vaults, the lights of the Tenori-on will hypnotize the most recalcitrant. If the silence could have been deadly, let's hope that everyone will come back safe and sound from the musical experience, even if the Danish singer, the Swedish percussionist and the French synthesist will not stop making them travel beyond what is usually heard!
