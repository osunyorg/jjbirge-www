    <p>  <br>The CD is the sound catalogue, conceived and realized by  Jean-Jacques BIRGÉ , of a huge exhibition at La Grande Halle de La Villette in Paris (curator  Zeev GOURARIER  / scenographer  Raymond SARTI ).    Beside the music by BIRGÉ-VITET and the dialogues by  Alain MONVOISIN  played by actors such as Michel BERTO, Menica BRUNET-FABULET, Dominique FONFRÈDE, Laurent JOUIN, Daniel LALOUX, Michael LONSDALE, Jean-Marie MADDEDDU and Luis REGO, the CD features fair organs, rare songs by Nane CHOLET and Renée LEBAS, Jean MARAIS (for a short novel by Jean COCTEAU),     On CD : Grimaces et Misère des Saltimbanques / Encore un tour de chevaux de bois / Le Pavillon des Curiosités / La fille au manège / Parade des Lutteurs / Si j'étais roi / Jeux de Massacre / Les petits pierrots / Les manèges de l'expo / Die Wacht am St Gotthard / La Confiserie Dédé / Le cinéma forain / Je l'ai perdue Exclusive bonus track: On index 9, the live reportage is not on the CD. It has been recorded by Jean-Jacques Birgé on the last day, after four months. Il était une fois la fête foraine  (many pictures on Sarti's site) </p>  <p>Curator : Zeev Gourrarier  Project director : Yolande Bacot Set designer : Raymond Sarti  Lights : Marie Christine Soma  Lights Design : Raymonde Couvreu  Sound Design & cover notes : Jean-Jacques Birgé  Music : Bernard Vitet et Jean-Jacques Birgé (Un Drame Musical Instantané)  Texts : Alain Monvoisin    Direction Technique Adjointe : Laurent Maintignon  Dispositifs spéciaux muséographiques : Christian Binet  Construction : Les Ateliers du Spectacle, Ateliers du Nord, Atelier Créa 3, Ateliers de la Grande Halle de la Villette Place : Grande Halle de la Villette</p>  <p>   <br>n°1 / Grimaces et misère des saltimbanques  / 5'38 <br>The band rounds up the crowd. Despite the gibes of his foil, a barker reels off his patter at the entrance of the "House of Illusions": puppets, conjurors, danse aérogyne, optical vues shows, the fairground cinema... This duo is riminiscent of The White Clown and the Auguste or of the Commedia dell' Arte. We find ourselves caught between forgetfulness and memories. With  Daniel Laloux ,  Michel Berto  and  Bernard Vitet  (trumpet) Music:  Birgé-Vitet  Grimaces et misère des saltimbanques, Chromovalse</p>  <p>n°2 / The House of Curiosities  / 7'33 <br>I the "House of Illusions", containing popular attractions, is intended to help ordinary people forget their humdrum lives and cast their worries to the winds, the "House of Curiosities" is aimed at those who aspire to middle-class dignity, offering them knowledge and discovery through hallucinating, kaleidoscopic displays of science and progress. If the "House of Illusions" may be likened to a telescope, the "House of Curiosities" is like a microscope. Here we enter the world of monsters and the mind is filled with the most terrible questions about humanity. With  Michael Lonsdale ,  Michel Berto ,  Dominique Fonfrède ,  Zeev Gourarier ,  Bernard Vitet Music:  Birgé-Vitet   Chromovalse, L'appel des abysses</p>  <p>n°3 / The Wrestlers' Parade  / 6'53 <br>Swindling, sham, conniving, showing-off, caricature, playing to the gallery - all that is to be found in wrestling, the life and soul of the fair. It's enjoyable and dramatic, it's sport and it's humbug - and all that without props, without any façade, and with no special effects - just showmanship - the art of causing a stir with limited means. Until quite recently, this fairground spirit was brilliantly represented by Jackson and his wrestlers, who inspired this text. With  Luis Rego ,  Michel Risse  (drums),  Raymond Sarti ,  Patrick Marijon ,  Bernard Vitet</p>  <p>n°4 / Aunt Sally  / 5'30 <br>Tthe fairground, with its various attractions, inspires not only fear and wonder, but also laughter and amusement. What greater fun than to let off steam and get rid of the pent-up frustrations that have built up over the days, weeks, years by demolishing the dummies in a game of Aunt Sally? And if you really want to work off your frustration, there's the shooting gallery, but it calls for concentration! Menica comes out with all the old patter. At the age of six, she "swallowed eggs" with her conjuror father. Then she looked after the curtain and the till, and became a mountebank and a crocodile woman, before marrying a lion-tamer. She was in charge of the quoits, the bingo, shies, targets, presented the giant rat, went into the cage with the hyenas and sold horoscopes and candyfloss! With  Menica Brunet Fabulet ,  Laurent Jouin ,  Jean Marie Maddeddu ,  Dominique Fonfrède ,  Alain Monvoisin . Music :  Birgé-Vitet   Toï et Moï ,  Blue Sax</p>  <p>n°5 / The Roundabouts  / 7'31 <br>The music of the various roundabouts - an organ for the carrousels with their wooden horses, gigantix musical boxes for the chair-o-planes, a saxophone band for the dodgems - gives the exhibition its colour. It mingles with the voices of the barkers and the connivers intermingling everywhere with the crowd. They make the exhibition seem like a haunted city or a distorting mirror. With  Jean-Jacques Birgé ,  Dominique Fonfrède ,  Elsa Birgé ,  Yolande Bacot Music:  Birgé-Vitet   Vaucanson, Place de l'Étoile</p>  <p>n°6 / Dédé's Sweet Stall  / 5'26 <br>A fair isn't a fair without the smell of waffles, sticky fingers, candyfloss and toffee apples. On the opther side of the wooden fences, the merry-go-round horses rear and come back to life. Who else would pull the caravans of the fairground folk?
