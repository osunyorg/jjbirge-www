    <p>  <br>24 hours of unissued music! From 1976 to 1977, Un Drame Musical Instantané, featuring  Jean-Jacques BIRGÉ, Bernard VITET et Francis GORGÉ , records improvisations which titles are all named from poisons. In 1977, singer  TAMIA  has joined the trio for one year. All these recordings made by Jean-Jacques Birgé , 7 rue de l'Espérance, Paris (except  Strychnine  which was recorded live at France Musique for  Les astronotes/Non écrites  by Pierre Lattès and Joséphine Markovits). The Drame always prefered to call these  improvisations  "instantaneous compositions" in opposition to "preliminary compositions". Birgé's synthétiseur is an ARP 2600. Gorgé's guitar is a Gibson SG Standard and his bass a Fender Precision.
