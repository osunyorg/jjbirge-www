His recording this summer in Peru of  L'aube à Shimiyacu   (Dawn at Shimiyacu)  in the Amazon rainforest inspired him to accompany it with two different versions of the opera he imagined with Antoine Schmitt in 2006.

The fairy-tale, minimalist music of the 100 plastic robots contrasts with the noise or drone music produced by the elytra of strange insects. After a hundred or so albums, most recently his  100th Anniversary (1952-2052)  and the 3 volumes of  Pique-nique au labo  with 48 soloists, this is Birgé's first album without any musicians, even at the controls.
