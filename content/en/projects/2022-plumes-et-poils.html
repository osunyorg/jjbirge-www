    Plumes et poils UN DRAME MUSICAL INSTANTANÉ

    <p>  <br>February 14, 2022 is a great day as it marks the return of  Un Drame Musical Instantané , officially disbanded in 2008. Jean-Jacques Birgé  and  Francis Gorgé  met in 1969 at the Lycée Claude Bernard, where they gave their first concert two years later. They played together in Epimanondas, made their sensational debut as Birgé Gorgé Shiroc in 1975 with the LP  Défense de , and finally shared the fabulous adventure of Un Drame Musical Instantané before splitting up in 1992. They will exceptionally appear on stage in 2014, shortly after the death of Bernard Vitet, the third member of the infernal trio, to whom this new record is tenderly dedicated.  Dominique Meens  met the Drame the year it was founded in 1976; the writer recorded an album with Birgé in 1984 and a dozen with Gorgé since 1992. The most amazing thing is the complicity of the three companions, rediscovered as it was after so many years, exactly 30 for Birgé and Gorgé! Spending just a few hours they recorded 15 short pieces that they mixed the following day. The order is preserved, first takes, no cuts, just a rebalancing of the tracks. Dominique Meens' texts are the guiding thread for the two composer-improvisers. They find in them the images they have always sought wherever they go, setting the scene which in turn gives the poet wings. His text  Plumes et poils  refers to the one by Michel Tournier that the Drame had chosen to play with the late singer Frank Royon Le Mée. The bestiary has always been a major inspiration for the writer as well as for the two musicians. But where will they nestle! The Gustave Doré engraving on the cover suggests a tragedy, but it is only a fable by Jean de La Fontaine. When you open the digipack, the movement of the photograph reveals another snapshot.
