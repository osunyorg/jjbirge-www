    <p>  <br>Jean-Jacques Birgé  The 100th Anniversary (1952-2052) </p>  <p>This album commemorates the centenary of Jean-Jacques Birgé, a multi-disciplinary artist whose musical work marked his time.In 2018 he turns to his past by composing one piece per decade, reflecting both his career and the times he went trough. As a tribute to his father who loved science fiction, he also imagines the decades to come, composing three anticipation pieces. This vectorial evocation resembles a shadow theatre whose appearances merge with reality. To conclude the album, the composer Sacha Gattino wrote a Tombeau in honor of his friend. For the sake of authenticity, Jean-Jacques Birgé mixes archives, the oldest of which dates from 1958, and recordings made with many musicians among his friends: singers Pascale Labbé, Birgitte Lyregaard, his daughter Elsa Birgé, his comrade of Un Drame Musical Instantané Bernard Vitet on the trumpet, trombonist Yves Robert, horn player Nicolas Chedmail, composer Antonin-Tri Hoang on bass clarinet, guitarists Hervé Legeay and Philippe Deschepper, cellist Didier Petit, Vincent Segal exceptionally on bass, drummers Cyril Atef and Éric Échampard, accordionist Michèle Buirette, sound designer Amandine Casadamont and Sacha Gattino mixing sampler, organ music box and whistle.The opera spans ten decades throughout which we can hear Jean-Jacques Birgé on the synthesizer, his major instrument which he has been one of the first to use in France since 1973, but also Theremin, Tenori-on, Mascarade Machine, trumpet, flute, inanga and jew's harp, his favorite. His voice is also present, from childhood to adulthood, including three passages he sings.  Étienne Mineur has designed the magnificent cover with a  52-pages booklet.
