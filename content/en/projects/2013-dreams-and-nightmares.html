    <p>  <br>Jean-Jacques Birgé asked  Antonin-Tri Hoang  and  Edward Perraud  to tell each one three dreams. With his it makes nine  Dreams and Nightmares  to play and improvise live. The tenth was told by a girl in the audience. Every dream was preceded by its story told by every one of us, as waking up and trying to remember. Recorded live by Benoît Tonnerre at Le Triton on January 31 2013, directly from the mixing table, so acoustic instruments such as drums are lower than reality. Blog  "J'ai fait un rêve..."

The first struck the ground about four miles away from me with such a terrible force, enormous noise and splashing that it drowned the entire countryside. I was so greatly shocked at this that I awoke before the cloudburst. And the ensuing downpour was huge. Some of the waters fell some distance away and some close by. And they came from such a height that they seemed to fall at an equally slow pace. But the very first water that hit the ground so suddenly had fallen at such velocity, and was accompanied by wind and roaring so frightening, that when I awoke my whole body trembled and I could not recover for a long time. When I arose in the morning, I painted the above as I had seen it. May the Lord turn all things to the best."
